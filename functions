Here is the technical summary of the functionalities for Trail Analyzer Pro V16, formatted specifically for optimal readability in text editors like Notepad.TRAIL ANALYZER PRO V16 - FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY1. GEOSPATIAL DATA INGESTION & PRE-PROCESSINGMulti-Format Parser: Support for GPX and KML files to extract 3D coordinates (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude).Adaptive Altimetric Smoothing: Implements a Savitzky-Golay filter with a dynamic window based on point density to eliminate GPS noise.Peak Protection Logic: A safety override that reverts to raw data if smoothing reduces peak altitude by more than 25 meters, preserving real summits.3D Geometry Calculation: Determines accurate cumulative distance and instantaneous slope (%) using the Haversine formula and elevation deltas.2. BIOENERGETIC DETERMINISTIC ENGINE (V16 CASCADE)Dynamic Walk Ratio (Target Anchor): Optimizes the r-local vector based on a biomechanical threshold ($G_{crit}$) and chronological stamina decay.Critical Slope Formula:$$G_{crit} = 12.0 + (VO2_{max} - 40) \cdot 0.15 + (W/kg - 2.5) \cdot 0.5$$.Adaptive Intensity Factor (IF): Calculates target intensity based on race distance, scaling from 0.87 (short races) to 0.72 (long endurance).Metabolic Cost Modeling: Integrates Pandolf and Gottschall models to estimate energy expenditure for both walking and running on varied terrain.Atmospheric Hypoxia Penalty: Reduces $VO_2$ max and power output based on real-time altitude using the barometric formula.Mechanical Wear Model: Simulates eccentric muscle damage from accumulated descent, reducing efficiency based on athlete and pack mass.3. STRATEGIC PLANNING & VISUALIZATION8-Tab Control Interface: Centralized management of Database, Setup, Performance, Climbs, Strategy, Splits, Maps, and Logs.Climb Detection System: Automatically identifies and ranks major climbs (Cat 4 to HC) using a slope-distance score.Bioenergetic Strategy Tab: Synchronized charts displaying altitude profile vs. glycogen depletion and instantaneous velocity.Kilometric Splits: Generates high-resolution intervals showing time, pace (min/km), power (W), and remaining energy for every kilometer.Probabilistic Time Estimation: Uses Z-Score and Gaussian density plots to visualize the probability of arrival times and confidence windows.4. OUTPUTS & LOGISTICSInteractive Folium Maps: Generates HTML maps with slope color-coding and markers for nutrition (food) and circadian fatigue (sleep) events.Logistics Layer: Projects aid stations (Basi Vita) and time gates onto maps and graphs for strategic pacing.Extended Excel Report: Exports a multi-sheet report containing full simulation telemetry, splits, and identified climbs.Clinical System Log: Real-time diagnostic console to monitor engine integrity and simulation progress.
