README.md: Trail Analyzer Pro V16Project OverviewTrail Analyzer Pro V16 is a deterministic bioenergetic simulation engine designed for strategic analysis of ultra-trail and mountain endurance races. Developed by Andrea Manna, the software integrates 3D topographic data with advanced physiological models to estimate athlete performance, energy depletion, and mechanical wear.Core Technical ArchitectureThe system operates through a multi-stage pipeline:Stage 0 (Entry Point): Multimedia initialization with synchronized video/audio splash screen.Stage 1 (QuickLook): Geometric inspection of GPX/KML tracks, implementing adaptive altimetric smoothing via Savitzky-Golay filters to remove GPS noise.Stage 2 (Main Dashboard): Cascade deterministic simulation with an 8-tab interface for strategic planning.Key Scientific ModelsThe software utilizes several validated physiological equations:Hypoxia Penalty: Calculates performance decrease based on the barometric formula:$$P = P_0 \cdot (1 - 2.25577 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot h)^{5.25588}$$Hybrid Energy Cost: Combines Pandolf (weighted walking) and Gottschall (running on slope) models, adjusted by a dynamic Walk Ratio.Rapoport Glycogen Model: Simulates carbohydrate depletion and the subsequent "hitting the wall" effect.Circadian Fatigue: Models central fatigue during the biological nadir (02:00 AM - 05:00 AM).RequirementsLanguage: Python 3.10+Dependencies: pandas, numpy, scipy, gpxpy, folium, matplotlib, tkinter, PIL, opencv-python, ffpyplayer.
